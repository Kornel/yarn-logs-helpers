# This file includes logic for computing a "cluster ID" from YARN application IDs. By default, application IDs will be
# of the form: "application_<cluster ID>_XXXX". The <cluster ID> resets every time the cluster is rebooted, and the X's
# represent a monotonically-increasing 4-digit number that uniquely identifies the application within this cluster-run.
#
# When this file is sourced, if no cluster ID is found, this file will attempt to fetch one.
